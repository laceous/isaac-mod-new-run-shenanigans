    <description>This mod requires REPENTOGON. Press the tilde key to open the new debug console and menu. There's a new Shenanigans option that will let you start a new randomized run.

[list]
    [*]Choose a difficulty (normal/hard/greed/greedier/random) or a random challenge
    [*]If you chose normal/hard/greed/greedier/random then you can select a random player type from regular, tainted, or both
    [*]Player types, difficulties, and challenges must be unlocked to be eligible for the randomization
    [*]You can disqualify player types, difficulties, or challenges from their respective tabs by deselecting them
    [*]You can also limit to player types with missing completion marks, or challenges that haven't been completed
[/list]

Note: challenges have a set player type and difficulty assigned to them.

When you press tilde to open the menu, the game may put you into keyboard mode. There's a controller option you can set if you're trying to play with a controller.</description>
